## Running

This is visible [on my website](http://benduncan.me/creations/ga-fsm/), or you can run it locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

> Note: If you have a modern version of `npm`, this will automatically run the `prepare` task, which does a build. Otherwise you will need to run `npm run build` yourself.

3. Run the server

```
npm start
```
